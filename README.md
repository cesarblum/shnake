# Introduction #

shnake is the classic snake game written in Bash
by Cesar L. B. Silveira (cesarbs _at_ gmail _dot_ com).

# How to play #

* w: move up
* s: move down
* a: move left
* d: move right
* q: quit

# Remarks #

* I haven't tested it on many platforms. I believe it works on any VT100
  terminal emulator. So far, I've seen it work on GNOME Terminal and
  Terminal (OS X).
* I don't know what's the minimum required version of Bash for shnake to
  work. I wrote it using Bash 3.2.
